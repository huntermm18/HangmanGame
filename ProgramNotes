Notes on game:
- If the user enters more that one character at a time, each character will be treated as an individual guess.
- If the user enters a letter that has already been guessed it will not count against them, and they will be prompted to guess again.
- All uppercase letters, numbers and symbols are accepted as input but will always be incorrect guesses.
- Once the stickman on the gallows has been fully built, additional incorrect guesses will be noted by a '.' symbol below the stickman.
